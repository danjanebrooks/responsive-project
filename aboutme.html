        My love for Greek food started as a child. As a family we would always
        go to Greece on holidays and I have lovely fond memories. Greece is a
        beautiful country and you can nearly always guarantee hot weather. I
        have always found Greek people very friendly and they are always willing
        to chat to you and have a good time. Whether it's mainland or one of the
        small islands, the country is steeped in history and has gorgeous views
        everywhere you go. It's also where the first theatre plays were
        performed in the Theatre of Dionysus which was built in Athens and
        having studied Drama & Theatre at University level, I think that adds to
        my love for Greece.

        I remember when I was younger and on holiday in Greece and trying a
        Greek salad for the first time. I was unsure on the olives but loved the
        feta cheese, red onion and the balsamic and oregano dressing. I started
        to try more and more Greek food from the menus and realised there was
        nothing I didn't like. From houmous and babaghanoush, to moussaka and
        Gyros. The food can be indulgent and rich like beef Stifado, or fresh
        and light like grilled meats and tzatziki. One of my favourite things is
        that you can eat Greek food in a tapas style way; grazing on lots of
        small plates of food meaning you can eat more of a variety of different
        things in one meal!
